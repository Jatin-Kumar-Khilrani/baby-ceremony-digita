# Spark Dependency Removal - Summary

## ✅ What Was Removed

### 1. **Package Dependencies**
- Removed `@github/spark` from package.json
- Cleaned up package-lock.json

### 2. **Configuration Files**
- Removed `.spark-initial-sha`
- Removed `runtime.config.json` 
- Removed `spark.meta.json`
- Removed Spark plugins from `vite.config.ts`
- Removed Spark environment variables from `vite-env.d.ts`

### 3. **Code Dependencies**
- Replaced `useKV` hooks with custom `useStorage` hooks
- Removed `@github/spark/spark` import from main.tsx
- Created independent Azure Storage service
- Updated all components to use new storage hooks

## 🔄 What Was Added

### 1. **Custom Storage System**
- `src/hooks/useStorage.ts` - Storage hooks that work with or without Azure
- `src/services/azureStorage.ts` - Azure Storage service using REST API
- `src/utils/migration.ts` - Migration utility (Spark-independent)

### 2. **Production-Ready Features**
- Azure Storage integration via REST API
- Automatic fallback to localStorage
- File upload capabilities for photos
- Global window.azureStorage for flexibility

### 3. **Enhanced Configuration**
- Azure Static Web Apps configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- Environment variable setup for Azure
- Comprehensive deployment guide

## 🎯 Benefits

### Production Compatibility
- **No more Spark dependencies** that don't work in production
- **Standard React/Vite setup** that works anywhere
- **Azure integration** using standard REST APIs
- **Cost-effective hosting** with Azure Static Web Apps

### Data Management
- **Seamless migration** from localStorage to Azure Storage
- **Automatic fallbacks** ensure the app always works
- **Production-grade storage** for RSVPs, wishes, and photos
- **Real-time data persistence** across devices

### Development Experience
- **Same API** as before - minimal code changes needed
- **Better error handling** and loading states
- **Development mode** works with localStorage
- **Production mode** uses Azure Storage

## 📊 Technical Comparison

| Feature | Before (Spark) | After (Independent) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Storage | `useKV` (Spark-only) | `useStorage` (universal) |
| Platform | GitHub Spark only | Any hosting platform |
| Production | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Azure production-ready |
| Cost | N/A | $1-5/month |
| Dependencies | Spark framework | Standard React/Vite |
| Data Persistence | Temporary | Permanent cloud storage |

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Ready for Production ✅
- Build system works without Spark
- Azure Storage integration complete
- Deployment documentation ready
- Migration tools available

### Next Steps
1. Set up Azure Storage Account
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
4. Run migration if needed
5. Share the invitation! 🎉
