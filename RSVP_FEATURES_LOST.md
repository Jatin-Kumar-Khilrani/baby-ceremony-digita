# ❌ RSVPForm.tsx Features Lost (Due to git checkout)

## What Was Lost

When I ran `git checkout src/components/RSVPForm.tsx`, the following features were removed:

### 1. **Google OAuth Integration**
- Import: `@react-oauth/google` package
- GoogleLogin component for sign-in
- JWT decoding for user info
- Google user state management

### 2. **PIN-Based Authentication**
- 4-digit PIN input field
- PIN verification logic
- Email search to find existing RSVPs

### 3. **Email Search Functionality**
- Search input for email address
- API call to backend: `POST /api/rsvps?action=search&email={email}`
- Sends PIN via email when RSVP found

### 4. **Edit/Delete with Verification**
- Edit button (requires Google OAuth or PIN)
- Delete button (requires Google OAuth or PIN)
- Verification check before allowing edit/delete

### 5. **Dual Authentication UI**
- Shows both Google Sign-In button AND PIN input
- Allows users to choose their preferred method
- Info messages about authentication options

## What Backend Expects (Currently Working)

The backend `api/rsvps/index.js` is **ready** and expects:

### API Endpoint for Search:
```
POST /api/rsvps?action=search&email={email}
```

**Response if found:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "found": true,
  "message": "PIN sent to your email"
}
```

**Response if not found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "found": false,
  "message": "No RSVP found with that email"
}
```

### Backend Flow:
1. User searches → Backend generates PIN
2. Backend sends email via Azure Communication Services
3. User receives email with 4-digit PIN
4. User enters PIN in frontend
5. Frontend compares PIN locally (stored in RSVP object)
6. If match → Allow edit/delete

## Current RSVPForm.tsx Status

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Basic RSVP submission
- ✅ Validation
- ✅ Display recent RSVPs

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Google OAuth
- ❌ Email search
- ❌ PIN verification
- ❌ Edit/Delete functionality
- ❌ API call to send PIN

## Options Moving Forward

### Option 1: Keep Simple (Current)
- Basic RSVP form
- No editing capability
- Works as-is
- **Backend ready but unused**

### Option 2: Add Minimal Search + PIN
- Add email search input
- Call backend to send PIN
- Add PIN verification
- Enable edit/delete
- **No Google OAuth needed**

### Option 3: Recreate Full OAuth + PIN (Original)
- Need to manually code all features
- Google OAuth + PIN dual auth
- Full edit/delete capability
- **Most feature-rich but most work**

## Good News!

The **GuestWishes.tsx** component in the stash HAS all the Google OAuth + PIN features! We can use it as a reference to recreate RSVPForm.tsx.

Would you like me to:
1. **Do nothing** - keep the simple RSVP form
2. **Add minimal search + PIN** - no OAuth, just email PIN
3. **Recreate full features** - based on GuestWishes.tsx pattern

The backend is ready for any option!
