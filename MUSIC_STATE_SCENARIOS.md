# üéµ Complete Music State Management - All Scenarios

## Problem Statement
Background music player needed to handle ALL possible user scenarios:
1. Music auto-starts, TTS plays, TTS ends ‚Üí Should music continue playing?
2. Music manually paused, TTS plays, TTS ends ‚Üí Should stay paused
3. Music playing, user pauses during TTS ‚Üí Should stay paused
4. Music paused, user plays during TTS ‚Üí Should keep playing
5. Multiple TTS plays in sequence ‚Üí Should maintain state across all

## Solution: State Tracking with `wasPlayingBeforeTTS`

### **Key Innovation:**
We track whether music was playing **before each TTS session** using a ref:
```typescript
const wasPlayingBeforeTTS = useRef<boolean>(false)
```

This allows us to restore the **exact state** the user expects after TTS completes.

## üìã All Scenarios Handled

### **Scenario 1: First Time User Clicks "Listen"**
```
Initial State: Music OFF, TTS OFF
User Action: Clicks "Listen" button
Expected: Music auto-starts, ducks for TTS, continues after TTS

Implementation:
1. isTTSPlaying changes to true
2. hasAutoStarted = false, isPlaying = false
3. Auto-start effect triggers
4. Music starts with fade-in
5. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true
6. isPlaying = true
7. Music ducks to 20%
8. TTS plays
9. TTS ends, isTTSPlaying = false
10. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true, isPlaying = true
11. Music restores to 25%
12. ‚úÖ Music continues playing
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Music Already Playing, User Clicks "Listen"**
```
Initial State: Music ON (25%), TTS OFF
User Action: Clicks "Listen" button
Expected: Music ducks, TTS plays, music restores, continues playing

Implementation:
1. isTTSPlaying changes to true
2. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true (saved)
3. isPlaying = true
4. Music ducks from 25% to 5% (20% of current)
5. TTS plays
6. TTS ends, isTTSPlaying = false
7. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true, isPlaying = true
8. Music restores from 5% to 25%
9. ‚úÖ Music continues playing
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Music Paused, User Clicks "Listen"**
```
Initial State: Music OFF (user paused), TTS OFF
User Action: Clicks "Listen" button
Expected: Music stays paused, TTS plays, music stays paused

Implementation:
1. isTTSPlaying changes to true
2. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = false (saved)
3. isPlaying = false
4. Music stays paused (no ducking needed)
5. TTS plays
6. TTS ends, isTTSPlaying = false
7. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = false, isPlaying = false
8. No action taken

```

---

### **Scenario 4: Music Playing, User Pauses During TTS**
```
Initial State: Music ON, TTS playing (ducked)
User Action: Clicks pause button during TTS
Expected: Music pauses immediately, stays paused after TTS

Implementation:
1. Music is playing at 5% (ducked)
2. User clicks pause button
3. togglePlay() called
4. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = false (updated)
5. Music fades out and pauses
6. isPlaying = false
7. TTS ends, isTTSPlaying = false
8. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = false, isPlaying = false
9. No action taken
10. ‚úÖ Music stays paused (user's choice)
```

---

### **Scenario 5: Music Paused, User Plays During TTS**
```
Initial State: Music OFF, TTS playing
User Action: Clicks play button during TTS
Expected: Music starts at full volume (25%), continues after TTS

Implementation:
1. Music is paused
2. TTS is playing
3. User clicks play button
4. togglePlay() called
5. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true (updated)
6. Music fades in to 25% (full volume, NOT ducked)
7. isPlaying = true
8. TTS ends, isTTSPlaying = false
9. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true, isPlaying = true
10. Music already at full volume
11. ‚úÖ Music continues playing at 25%
```

---

### **Scenario 6: Multiple TTS in Sequence**
```
Initial State: Music ON (25%)
User Action: Clicks "Listen" on wish 1, then wish 2, then wish 3
Expected: Music ducks/restores for each, stays playing throughout

Implementation:
Wish 1:
1. TTS starts, wasPlayingBeforeTTS = true
2. Music ducks to 5%
3. TTS ends, music restores to 25%

Wish 2:
4. TTS starts, wasPlayingBeforeTTS = true (still)
5. Music ducks to 5%
6. TTS ends, music restores to 25%

Wish 3:
7. TTS starts, wasPlayingBeforeTTS = true (still)
8. Music ducks to 5%
9. TTS ends, music restores to 25%

‚úÖ Music plays continuously, ducking for each TTS
```

---

### **Scenario 7: User Adjusts Volume During TTS**
```
Initial State: Music ON (25%), TTS playing (ducked to 5%)
User Action: Moves volume slider to 50%
Expected: Volume saves, applies after TTS ends

Implementation:
1. Music ducked to 5% (20% of 25%)
2. volumeBeforeDuck.current = 0.25
3. User moves slider to 0.5
4. volume state = 0.5
5. volumeBeforeDuck.current stays 0.25 (not updated)
6. TTS ends
7. Music restores to volumeBeforeDuck.current = 0.25
8. Then regular volume effect applies: 0.5
9. ‚úÖ Music ends up at 50% (user's new preference)
```

---

### **Scenario 8: Auto-Play Blocked by Browser**
```
Initial State: Music OFF, TTS OFF

Implementation:
1. Auto-start attempted
2. Browser blocks (security policy)
3. playPromise.catch() triggered
4. wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = false
5. Toast: "üéµ Click play button to enable music"
6. User clicks play button

2. isPlaying = false
3. No ducking (music already paused)
4. TTS plays
5. TTS ends
6. wasPlayingBeforeTTS = false, isPlaying = false
7. No action taken
8. Music stays paused

‚úÖ User's pause preference respected across all wishes
```

---

### **Scenario 10: User Manually Starts Music Mid-TTS**
```

Expected: Music starts at FULL volume (not ducked), continues after TTS

Implementation:
1. TTS is playing
2. Music is paused
3. User clicks play
4. togglePlay() starts music at full 25%

## üéØ State Tracking Logic

### **Key Variables:**
```typescript
// Component State
isPlaying: boolean              // Current play/pause state
volume: number                  // Current volume (0-1)
isMuted: boolean               // Mute state
isTransitioning: boolean       // Volume fade in progress

// Refs (persistent across renders)
audioRef: HTMLAudioElement     // Audio element
volumeBeforeDuck: number       // Volume before ducking
wasPlayingBeforeTTS: boolean   // State before TTS started
hasAutoStarted: boolean        // Has auto-start occurred
```

### **State Update Points:**

#### **When TTS Starts:**
```typescript
if (isTTSPlaying) {
  wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = isPlaying  // Save current state
  
  if (isPlaying) {
    volumeBeforeDuck.current = volume      // Save current volume
    // Duck to 20%
  }
  // If paused, do nothing
}
```

#### **When TTS Ends:**
```typescript
if (!isTTSPlaying) {
  if (wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current && isPlaying) {
    // Restore volume (was playing, still playing)
  } else if (!wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current && isPlaying) {
    // User started during TTS - keep full volume
  } else if (wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current && !isPlaying) {
    // User paused during TTS - stay paused
  }
  // else: was paused, still paused - do nothing
}
```

#### **When User Clicks Play:**
```typescript
togglePlay() {
  if (!isPlaying) {
    wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true  // Update tracker
    // Start music
  }
}
```

#### **When User Clicks Pause:**
```typescript
togglePlay() {
  if (isPlaying) {
    wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = false  // Update tracker
    // Pause music
  }
}
```

---

## üîç Decision Tree

```
TTS Starts
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Is music playing?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Save wasPlaying=true, Duck volume to 20%
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Save wasPlaying=false, Do nothing
‚îÇ
TTS Ends
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Was music playing before TTS?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ YES
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Is music still playing?
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Restore volume (normal flow)
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí User paused, stay paused
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ Is music playing now?
‚îÇ     ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí User started, keep full volume
‚îÇ     ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Was paused, stay paused
```

## üé® User Experience

### **Seamless Scenarios:**
‚úÖ **Auto-start**: Music begins peacefully on first "Listen"
‚úÖ **Ducking**: Voice always clear, music in background
‚úÖ **Restore**: Music returns smoothly after each TTS
‚úÖ **Pause respected**: User's pause choice maintained
‚úÖ **Play during TTS**: Music starts at full volume (not ducked)
‚úÖ **Multiple wishes**: Consistent behavior across all

### **Edge Cases Handled:**
‚úÖ **Browser blocks auto-play**: Helpful toast notification
‚úÖ **Rapid TTS succession**: Smooth ducking for each
‚úÖ **Volume changes during TTS**: Applied after TTS ends
‚úÖ **Pause/play during TTS**: State tracked correctly
‚úÖ **Mixed interactions**: All combinations work logically

## üíª Code Snippets

### **Main Ducking Logic:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!audioRef.current) return

  if (isTTSPlaying) {
    // TTS just started - save state
    wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = isPlaying
    
    if (isPlaying) {
      // Duck volume
      volumeBeforeDuck.current = volume
      // Smooth transition to 20%
    }
  } else {
    // TTS just finished - restore based on saved state
    if (wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current && isPlaying) {
      // Restore volume
    }
    // Other scenarios handled
  }
}, [isTTSPlaying, isPlaying, volume, isMuted])
```

### **Toggle Play with State Tracking:**
```typescript
const togglePlay = () => {
  if (isPlaying) {
    wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = false  // Update tracker
    // Pause
  } else {
    wasPlayingBeforeTTS.current = true   // Update tracker
    // Play
  }
}
```
