# 🔧 Admin Email/PIN Display Fix

## 🐛 Issue Found

When using existing values from `.env`, the admin email and PIN were showing as empty:

```
Using existing Admin Email: 
Using existing Admin PIN from .env
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

**PowerShell variable scoping in if-expressions:**

```powershell
# ❌ BROKEN - $adminEmail doesn't exist yet!
$adminEmail = if ($envVars.ContainsKey('VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL')) { 
    $envVars['VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL']
    Write-Host "Using existing Admin Email: $adminEmail"  # Empty!
    $adminEmail  # Also empty!
}
```

**Problem:**
- The variable `$adminEmail` is being assigned by the if-expression
- Inside the if-block, `$adminEmail` doesn't exist yet
- Write-Host tries to use a non-existent variable → shows as empty
- The return value is also referencing a non-existent variable

## ✅ The Fix

Use a temporary variable that exists within the if-block:

```powershell
# ✅ FIXED - Use temporary variable $email
$adminEmail = if ($envVars.ContainsKey('VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL')) { 
    $email = $envVars['VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL']
    Write-Host "Using existing Admin Email: $email"  # Shows value!
    $email  # Returns value!
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Create temporary variable `$email` from `.env` value
2. Display `$email` (which exists and has a value)
3. Return `$email` (which gets assigned to `$adminEmail`)

## 📋 Changes Applied

### Before
```powershell
$adminEmail = if ($envVars.ContainsKey('VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL')) { 
    $envVars['VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL']
    Write-Host "Using existing Admin Email: $adminEmail"  # ❌ Empty
    $adminEmail  # ❌ Empty
}

$adminPinPlain = if ($envVars.ContainsKey('VITE_ADMIN_PIN')) { 
    $envVars['VITE_ADMIN_PIN']
    Write-Host "Using existing Admin PIN from .env"
    $adminPinPlain  # ❌ Empty
}
```

### After
```powershell
$adminEmail = if ($envVars.ContainsKey('VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL')) { 
    $email = $envVars['VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL']
    Write-Host "Using existing Admin Email: $email"  # ✅ Shows value
    $email  # ✅ Returns value
}

$adminPinPlain = if ($envVars.ContainsKey('VITE_ADMIN_PIN')) { 
    $pin = $envVars['VITE_ADMIN_PIN']
    Write-Host "Using existing Admin PIN from .env"
    $pin  # ✅ Returns value
}
```

## 🎯 What Works Now

**Before:**
```
Using existing Admin Email: 
Using existing Admin PIN from .env
```

**After:**
```
Using existing Admin Email: jatin.khilrani@yahoo.com
Using existing Admin PIN from .env
```

## 💡 Key Takeaway

When using if-expressions for variable assignment in PowerShell:

❌ **Don't** reference the variable being assigned inside the if-block  
✅ **Do** use a temporary variable and return it

This is because:
- The assignment happens **after** the if-expression completes
- Inside the block, the variable doesn't exist yet
- Use a temporary variable that exists within the block scope

## ✅ Impact

- ✅ Admin email now displays correctly
- ✅ Admin PIN value properly assigned
- ✅ User can see what values are being loaded from `.env`
- ✅ Better transparency in script execution
