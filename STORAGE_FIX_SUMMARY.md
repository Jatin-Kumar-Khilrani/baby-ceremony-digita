# ✅ Storage Account Detection - All Issues Fixed!

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Only showing "b"
```
✅ Found storage account: b
```
❌ **Problem:** Showed only first character instead of full name

### Issue #2: Trim method error
```
Method invocation failed because [System.Char] does not contain a method named 'Trim'.
```
❌ **Problem:** PowerShell treated single result as string, not array

## 🔧 The Fix

### Root Cause
PowerShell has unexpected behavior when pipeline returns single value:
- Multiple results → Creates array automatically ✅
- **Single result → Creates string, not array!** ❌

### Solution Applied
```powershell
# Force array creation with @()
$accountList = @($detectedAccounts -split "`r?`n" | Where-Object { $_.Trim() -ne "" } | ForEach-Object { $_.Trim() })
```

**Key elements:**
1. **`@(...)`** - Forces result to be an array (even with 1 item)
2. **`\r?\n`** - Handles Windows line endings
3. **`ForEach-Object { $_.Trim() }`** - Trims in pipeline (not after)

## ✅ What Works Now

### Single Storage Account
```
Checking for storage accounts in resource group: baby-ceremony-rg...
✅ Found storage account: babyceremonystorage
```
✅ Shows **full name** instead of "b"  
✅ No Trim method errors

### Multiple Storage Accounts
```
Found multiple storage accounts:
  [1] babyceremonyprod
  [2] babyceremonystaging
  [3] babyceremondev

Select storage account (1-3) or enter new name: 1
```
✅ Shows all **full names**  
✅ Selection works correctly

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

Run the script:
```powershell
.\setup-production.ps1
```

✅ **Test 1:** Single storage account detected → Should show full name  
✅ **Test 2:** Multiple accounts detected → Should show numbered list  
✅ **Test 3:** No errors when accessing array → Should complete successfully

## 📝 Summary

**Before:**
- ❌ Showed "b" instead of full name
- ❌ "Trim" method errors
- ❌ Unreliable array handling

**After:**
- ✅ Shows full storage account names
- ✅ No method invocation errors  
- ✅ Consistent array behavior
- ✅ Works with 1 or multiple accounts
