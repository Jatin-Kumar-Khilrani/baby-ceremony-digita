# 🎉 Storage Account Auto-Detection - Feature Summary

## What Changed?

The `setup-production.ps1` script now **automatically detects** your storage account name from Azure, so you don't need to remember or manually enter it!

## Before (Old Behavior)
```
Storage Account name (lowercase, no spaces, e.g., babyceremonystorage): ???
```
😕 You had to remember or look up the storage account name every time

## After (New Behavior)

### When .env has placeholder value:
```
Checking for storage accounts in resource group: baby-ceremony-rg...
✅ Found storage account: babyceremonystorage
```
✨ Script automatically finds and uses your storage account!

### When multiple accounts exist:
```
Found multiple storage accounts:
  [1] babyceremonyprod
  [2] babyceremonystaging

Select storage account (1-2) or enter new name: 1
```
✨ Script shows a menu to choose from!

## How It Works

1. **Check .env first** - If storage account name is valid (not placeholder), use it
2. **Query Azure** - If not valid, query resource group for storage accounts
3. **Auto-select** - If only one found, use it automatically
4. **Let user choose** - If multiple found, show selection menu
5. **Prompt for new** - If none found, ask for new name

## Key Features

✅ **Ignores Placeholder** - Detects `your-storage-account-name` and queries Azure instead  
✅ **Single Account** - Auto-detects and asks confirmation  
✅ **Multiple Accounts** - Shows numbered list to choose from  
✅ **No Accounts** - Falls back to manual entry  
✅ **Saves to .env** - Updates .env with detected account for future use

## Your Current Setup

Since your `.env` file currently has:
```env
VITE_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=your-storage-account-name
```

The next time you run `setup-production.ps1`:
1. Script sees the placeholder value
2. Queries Azure for storage accounts in your resource group
3. If found, automatically selects it for you
4. Updates `.env` with the real storage account name

## Try It Now!

```powershell
.\setup-production.ps1
```

When prompted:
- **Use existing values from .env?** → Choose `y`
- Script will detect your storage account automatically!
- No need to remember or type the name 🎉
